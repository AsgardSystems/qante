qante - Query ANnotated TExt
============================

Motivation
----------

Extracting the highly-valuable data from unstructured text often
results in hard-to-read, brittle, difficult-to-maintain code.
The problem is that using regular expressions directly embedded
in the program control flow does not provide the best level of
abstraction. We propose a query language (based on the tuple
relational calculus) that facilitates data extraction.
Developers can explicitly express their intent declaratively,
making their code much easier to write, read, and maintain.

Solution
--------

This package allows programmers to express what they are searching
for by using higher-level concepts to express their query as tags,
locations, and expressions on location relations.
The *location* of a string of characters within the document is
the interval defining its starting and ending position.
Locations are grouped into sets named by *tags*.  Tags can be
used in conjunctions and disjunctions of interval relations to
query for tuples of locations.

|  where we showed this material from our `GitHub`_ repo:
|  ∙ `pydataG22.pdf`_ slides of our talk.
|  ∙ `ipynb/pydata.ipynb`_ a ``jupyter notebook`` with examples.
|
| Use pip or python (rev 3 or above) to install from `PyPI`_:
|  ``pip install qante`` (or ``python -m pip install qante``)

Use python docstrings for API Documentation::

  python    # rev 3 or above
    from quante.tagger import Tagger
    from quante.query import Query
    from quante import loctuple as lt
    from quant.table import get_table

    help(Tagger)    # annotate text with tags using tagRE('tagname', regexp)
    help(Query)     # Syntax for querying annotated text
    help(lt)        # Predicates used by queries
    help(get_table) # extract table (as dictionaries) from text
